# I'm Sai Kalyan


 👋 Hi there
I'm a passionate DevOps and Full-Stack enthusiast currently pursuing my graduate studies at Northeastern University. I thrive at the intersection of software development and infrastructure automation. I love building scalable, cloud-native systems with robust CI/CD pipelines and infrastructure as code.

### 🚀 What I Do

💻 Cloud & DevOps: Proficient in AWS, Terraform, Packer, GitHub Actions, Docker, and monitoring with CloudWatch. I’ve built secure, production-ready infrastructure using infrastructure-as-code and automated workflows.

🧱 Microservices Development: Currently working on a URL Shortener System using Java Spring Boot, MySQL, and REST APIs with a clean microservices architecture.


📦 CI/CD & Infrastructure Automation: Built end-to-end CI/CD pipelines deploying to multiple AWS accounts, with auto-scaling groups, KMS encryption, SSL/TLS security, and secrets management.


🛠️ Tools & Tech: Java, Spring Boot, MySQL, AWS (EC2, RDS, S3, IAM), Terraform, GitHub Actions, Linux, Shell Scripting, Docker, REST APIs.


### 📌 Featured Projects

🔗 URL Shortener System (in progress): A scalable, microservices-based backend using Spring Boot and MySQL with AWS integration, custom health checks, and observability.

☁️ Cloud-Native Web Application: Health check API with automated RDS integration, image uploads to S3, and secure secret handling using AWS IAM & Secrets Manager.

🔄 Infrastructure Automation: Built immutable AMIs with Packer, managed secure deployments using Terraform across DEV and DEMO environments, and implemented lifecycle policies for S3 and RDS.
